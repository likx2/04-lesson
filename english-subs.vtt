00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.730
The ocean is really, really
deep, deeper, in fact,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.380
than most of us realize.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.340
If you were to shave
off all of the land

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.980
from the tops of every continent
and island in the world

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.690
and fill up the ocean's
deepest points with that land,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.300
then the entire earth
would be covered

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.660
in an ocean 2 miles deep.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.750
Three fourths of our
planet is already

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.280
covered in water though,
and it goes a lot deeper

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.110
than just two miles.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.990
Let's start with
a sense of scale.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.850
This dot right here is the
size of an average human.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.490
This slightly larger dot
is the size of an elephant.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.330
And this is the size of the
largest ship ever built,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.520
the Knock Nevis.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.900
With that in mind, let's
start going under water

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.000
and see what we find out.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.040
The first milestone
is at 40 meters

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.630
below the surface, which is
the maximum depth allowed

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.540
for recreational scuba diving.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.650
A little further
down at 93 meters

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.800
is where the wreck of the
Lusitania was discovered,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.750
which is interesting
because the Lusitania

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.090
itself is 240 meters
long, which means

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.590
that it sank in water
shallower than it is long.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.170
So if the ship was standing
on its stern or bow,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.230
it would be sticking
out of the water.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.810
Just slightly deeper
than that at 100 meters

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.460
is where diving can become
seriously fatal if you're not

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.950
careful because of
decompression sickness.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.960
But that didn't stop a man named
Herbert Nitsch to accomplish

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.530
the free diving world record
at a depth of 214 meters.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.620
This guy swam down to this level
with just one single breath.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.620
But a little further
down at 332 meters,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.490
we have the scuba
diving world record

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.450
which was accomplished by
another man named Ahmed Gabr.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.229
If he had swam down
another 111 meters then

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.770
he would have reached the height
of the Empire State Building

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.650
if it was submerged under water.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.940
And a little further
than that at 500 meters

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.390
below the surface, we
arrive at the maximum dive

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.280
depth of Blue Whales, the
largest creatures on the planet

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.200
and also the limit of the
US Seawolf Class Nuclear

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.320
Submarine.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.690
At 535 meters we can
witness the maximum dive

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.360
depth of Emperor Penguins.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.870
And this is one we must bring
up the intensity of water

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.610
pressure.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.960
At this level below the
surface, the water pressure

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.930
exerted on a person
or the penguins

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.870
would be roughly
equivalent to a polar bear

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.130
standing on a quarter.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.180
So further down the
depths at 830 meters

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.410
would be the height of the Burj
Khalifa in Dubai, the tallest

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.740
building in the world.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.640
Once we hit 1,000 meters
below the surface,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.770
we begin to enter
the scary zone.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.830
Light from the surface can no
longer reach beyond this point,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.550
so the rest of
the ocean below is

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.900
shrouded in permanent darkness.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.650
On top of that,
the water pressure

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.160
you would experience at this
point would be about the same

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.830
as if you were standing on the
surface of the planet Venus,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.890
meaning that you would
die very quickly.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.200
You would also meet the
Giant Squid at this sea level

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.320
if the water pressure
didn't already kill you.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.840
At 1,280 meters we reach
the maximum depth dived to

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.470
by the Leatherback Sea Turtle.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.460
And further down
at 1,828 meters we

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.570
would reach the deepest
part of the Grand Canyon

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.580
were it to be
underwater with us.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.620
Down at 2,000 meters, we start
to encounter some of the more

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.270
terrifying sea creatures
like the ominously named

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.480
Black Dragonsih, a carnivorous
beast with a stomach that

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.700
doesn't allow light to
be emitted through it.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.270
Meaning that since we are
in total darkness underwater

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.960
at this point, the only way
you would ever see this thing

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.560
is with a flashlight.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.770
A little further
down at 2,250 meters

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.930
we would reach the
maximum depth dived to

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.860
by both Sperm Whales and the
very frightening Colossal

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.640
Squid.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.550
Sperm Whales often have
sucker marks and scars

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.220
left on their bodies from
battles with the Colossal Squid

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.070
that likely take place at
these incredible depths.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.140
The squids themselves can
grow to be 14 meters long

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.830
and weigh up to 750
kilograms with eyes

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.490
the size of a dinner plate
and razor-sharp sickles

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.060
in the middle of
their tentacles.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.800
So yeah, good luck
with that down there.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.820
Way further down
at 3,800 meters we

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.180
can find the wreck
of the RMS Titanic.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.470
And a bit past that
at 4,000 meters,

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.280
we start to enter the
Abyssal Zone of the ocean.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.240
Water pressure is at an
astonishing 11,000 pounds

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.670
per square inch down here.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.750
And there are numerous
strange, almost

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.040
alien like creatures that
inhabit these depths,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.430
such as the Fing Tooth,
Angler Fish, and Viper Fish.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.869
Down at 4,267 meters
is the average depth

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:07.410
of the ocean where
you would normally

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.669
expect to hit the floor.

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.210
But there are parts of the ocean
that go significantly deeper

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.410
than even this.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.320
At 4,791 meters rests the
wreckage of the battleship

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.360
Bismarck, sunk
during World War II.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.920
And way down at 6,000
meters is the beginning

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.790
of the Hadal Zone, named after
the underworld Hades, itself.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.710
The water pressure
down at these depths

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.170
can become 1,100 times
what you would experience

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.240
way back on top at
the surface, which

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.280
is roughly equal to an elephant
balancing on a postage stamp,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.130
or a single person carrying
the weight of 50 Boeing 747

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.400
jumbo jets.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.830
Down at these depths, you
would be crushed immediately

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.620
without any outside protection.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.960
But life still exists down
here in various strange forms.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.180
At 6,500 meters we
reach the maximum depth

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.150
that the DSV Alvin can
dive to, a popular research

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.550
submarine that helped
to discover the Titanic.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.940
Way further down at 8,848 meters
below the surface and we have

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.300
arrived at the height of Mt.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.460
Everest, were it to be upside
down and placed underwater.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.790
And then way further past
even that at 10,898 meters,

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.140
we arrive at the depth reached
by James Cameron in 2012

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.180
during the Deep Sea
Challenger Mission.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.580
The deepest point of the
ocean yet reached by humans

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.850
was back in 1960
though, when two men

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.230
named Don Walsh and
Jacques Piccard reached

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.670
a depth of 10,916 meters using
their [? Trieste ?] submarine.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.390
It took them five hours to
descend through the ocean

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.100
to this depth.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.770
And they only stayed
for 20 minutes

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.960
before a window cracked and
they began to resurface.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.750
Just a bit further
down from there

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.220
at 10,972 meters and we've
reached the average flight

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.320
altitude of a
commercial airliner.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.000
So if you've ever looked out
of a window while on a flight

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.700
and looked down to
the ground, that's

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.420
a very good sense
of how incredibly

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.570
deep down into the abyss
that we are currently at.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.990
Finally, when we
hit 10,994 meters

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.870
we have hit the bottom
of the known ocean,

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.540
called the Challenger Deep,
right here on this map

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.240
just about 300 kilometers
southwest of Guam Island.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.190
However, it is believed that
there are almost certainly

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.510
even deeper parts of the
ocean than this that just

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.160
haven't been discovered yet.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.710
It wasn't until
1997 after all that

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.230
the Sirena Deep was discovered
with a depth of 10,732 meters,

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.000
making it the second deepest
known point in the ocean.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.240
It is estimated that only
about 5% of the ocean's floor

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.560
has been accurately mapped,
leaving the other 95% to be

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.110
currently a mystery.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.990
It may be only a matter of
time before an even deeper part

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.550
of our ocean is found.
